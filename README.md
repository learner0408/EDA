# EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
In this project I have applied some of the basic Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques on Dataset of Bestselling Books on Amazon from Year 2009-2019.

Dataset:- It contains data of top 5 best selling books each year on Amazon from Year 2009-2019. The size of the Dataset is (550,7) , where each instance is having attributes - (i) Name of the Book (ii) Author Name (iii) User Rating (iv) Reviews (v) Price (vi) Year (vii) Genre .

EDA Techniques used:-
1) Removing Duplicates
2) Checking for Null Values
3) Finding Outliers
4) Scatterplot
5) Heatmap
6) And some other dataset specific techniques
